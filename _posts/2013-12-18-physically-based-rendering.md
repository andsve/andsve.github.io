This is a collection of Physically Based Rendering/Shading/Lighting material I've found scattered around the web. I believe it's quite handy to have a list like this on various rendering topics, hopefully it can be of use for somebody! And if you find something I have missed, please [let me know](mailto:me@svenandersson.se)!
